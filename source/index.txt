======================================
Welcome to MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``)
======================================

.. introduction::

   The |mdb-shell|, ``mongosh``, is a JavaScript and Node.js 16.x |repl| 
   environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments in Atlas, locally,
   or on another remote host. Use the |mdb-shell| to test queries and 
   operations directly with your database.

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Access MongoDB From Your Shell
------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connect to MongoDB
      :tabid: connect

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Connect to Atlas

            You can connect to a MongoDB deployment in Atlas using the 
            Atlas connection string:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb+srv://mycluster.abcd1.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --apiVersion 1 --username <username>

         .. step:: Connect to a Local Deployment

            You can connect to a local deployment on the default port with
            one simple command:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh

         .. step:: Connect to a Remote Host

            You can connect to a remote host using a connection string that
            includes the chosen host and port:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:28015"

            Or you can use the ``--host`` and ``--port`` command-line options:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh --host mongodb0.example.com --port 28015

         .. step:: Learn More

            For additional details about connecting to a deployment on Atlas, 
            including how to get the Atlas connection string, refer to 
            :ref:`Connect to a Database Deployment <atlas-connect-to-deployment>`
            in the Atlas documentation.

            For details about connecting to a non-default local port, 
            connecting with authentication, or other options, refer to 
            :ref:`mdb-shell-connect`.

            Explore a tutorial that uses the |mdb-shell| with JavaScript to
            access MongoDB: :ref:`mdb-shell-write-scripts`.

         .. step:: Package and Distribute Snippets

            into :binary:`~bin.mongosh`: :ref:`mongosh-scoping`.

            Or learn how to work with database query results in class 
            constructor functions, non-async generator functions, or callbacks
